Element Desktop related TODO list:
1. command line argument
2. open element of type "dmovie"

Other TODO list:
1. re-add last played file history, but should have a UI mode similiar to gedit's recent files.
2. remove preview function, too disturbing. Remove the code to lower the maintainance cost.
3. fix the width of config dialog
4. fix the glith in ControlBar
